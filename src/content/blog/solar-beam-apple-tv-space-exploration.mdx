## Why I Created Solar Beam

I've always been captivated by the night sky and wanted to share that sense of wonder with others. Solar Beam offers an immersive space exploration experience right from the comfort of your living room, designed specifically for tvOS 18 and later.

## Features That Bring the Universe Home

### 1. Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) Gallery

Every day, you'll be greeted with breathtaking new images of our universe courtesy of NASA's renowned APOD service. But I didn't stop there—I've incorporated machine learning technology to provide fascinating insights and stories behind each image, deepening your understanding of the cosmos.

- **Grid View**: Browse through stunning space imagery
- **Immersive View**: Full-screen cosmic experiences  
- **Detail View**: In-depth exploration with ML-powered insights

### 2. James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Gallery

I'm in awe of the incredible images that humanity's most advanced space telescope has captured, and I knew I had to include them. From the birth of stars to the depths of distant galaxies, you'll have front-row seats to the most spectacular views of our universe.

### 3. Mars Rover Gallery

Join me on an adventure to the Red Planet! I've curated a collection of stunning images captured by NASA's Mars Rovers. Together, we'll explore the Martian landscape and uncover the rovers' groundbreaking discoveries.

### 4. Near-Earth Object (NEO) Charts

I've always been fascinated by the celestial bodies that pass close to our planet. That's why I included detailed charts of asteroids and comets that venture near Earth. It's my way of combining education with a touch of cosmic vigilance. The app contains several charts that visualize NEOs differently.

## My Vision for Solar Beam

When I set out to create Solar Beam, my goal was simple: to ignite curiosity and wonder. I wanted to make the marvels of space accessible to everyone, fostering a deeper appreciation for the cosmos and inspiring the next generation of astronomers and space explorers.

Solar Beam is more than just an app to me—it's a portal to the universe that I'm excited to share with you. Whether you're a seasoned astronomer, a curious student, or a family looking for educational entertainment, I've designed Solar Beam with you in mind.

I've worked hard to create a user-friendly interface that makes navigation a breeze, allowing you to effortlessly journey from the Moon to the edge of the observable universe. The Apple TV platform provides the perfect canvas for these cosmic visuals, transforming your living room into a personal planetarium.

**Solar Beam is available now on the Apple TV App Store for tvOS 18 and later.**
