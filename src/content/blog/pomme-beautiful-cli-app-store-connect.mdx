## Before

```bash
# Logging into App Store Connect...
# Navigating through multiple screens...
# Waiting for slow page loads...
# Manually downloading CSV files...
# Opening Excel to analyze sales data...
# Switching tabs to check reviews...
# Getting frustrated with the UI...
```

## After

```bash
$ pomme sales
┌─────────────┬──────────────┬────────────┬────────────────┐
│ App         │ Units        │ Revenue    │ Territory      │

$ pomme reviews summary MyApp
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Average Rating: 4.7/5 (1,234 reviews)
```

If you're an iOS developer, you know the pain. Accessing your App Store Connect data means navigating through a web interface that feels like it was designed to test your patience. Want to check yesterday's sales? Click, wait, click, wait, download a CSV, open Excel. Need to see recent reviews? More clicking, more waiting. What if you could access all this data instantly from your terminal?

## Why App Store Connect Needs a CLI

Consider how often you check your app's performance. Sales numbers, review ratings, crash reports – these are the metrics that matter. Yet Apple's web interface treats each data point like a treasure hunt. You'll find yourself clicking through the same navigation paths dozens of times per week, wasting precious minutes that add up to hours.

The irony is striking: we build beautiful, efficient apps for our users, but we're stuck with a cumbersome web interface for our own data. That's where **Pomme** comes in – a Go-based CLI that brings the joy back to accessing your App Store data.

## What Makes Pomme Different

### Built for Real Developers

Pomme isn't just another wrapper around Apple's APIs. It's designed with a deep understanding of what developers actually need:

- **Zero Dependencies Philosophy**: Only uses `cobra` for CLI and `jwt` for auth. No bloated framework, no configuration hell.
- **Smart Defaults**: Handles Apple's quirky 5-day delay for monthly reports automatically.
- **Beautiful Output**: Data that's actually readable in your terminal, with proper formatting and colors.
- **Lightning Fast**: In-memory caching and concurrent processing mean instant results after the first request.

### Installation That Just Works

```bash
# Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew tap username/pomme
brew install pomme

# Go Install
go install github.com/username/pomme/cmd/pomme@latest

# Direct Download
curl -L https://github.com/username/pomme/releases/latest/download/pomme_$(uname -s)_$(uname -m).tar.gz | tar xz
sudo mv pomme /usr/local/bin/
```

## Setting Up in 60 Seconds

Pomme features an interactive setup wizard that guides you through the authentication process:

```bash
$ pomme config init

## Real-World Usage

### Checking Sales Performance

Instead of navigating through multiple screens, get instant insights:

```bash
# Current month sales (handles the 5-day delay automatically)
$ pomme sales

# Compare performance
$ pomme sales compare --months 3
┌─────────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬────────┐
│ App         │ Nov 2024 │ Dec 2024 │ Jan 2025 │ Change │
├─────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼────────┤
│ MyApp Pro   │ $2,341   │ $3,456   │ $4,567   │ +32.2% ↑│
│ MyApp Lite  │ $567     │ $432     │ $654     │ +51.4% ↑│
└─────────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴────────┘

# Analyze trends
$ pomme sales trends --period quarterly --group-by country
```

### Managing Reviews Efficiently

Reviews are your direct line to users. Pomme makes monitoring and responding effortless:

```bash
# Get a quick summary
$ pomme reviews summary com.example.myapp
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Average Rating: 4.7/5 (1,234 total reviews)

Rating Distribution:
5 ⭐ ████████████████████ 78% (962)
4 ⭐ ████████             32% (198)
3 ⭐ ██                    5% (42)
2 ⭐ █                     2% (21)
1 ⭐ █                     1% (11)

# Focus on critical feedback
$ pomme reviews list com.example.myapp --rating 1,2 --sort critical
┌──────────┬─────────┬──────────────────────────────────┬───────────┐
│ Rating   │ User    │ Review                           │ Version   │
├──────────┼─────────┼──────────────────────────────────┼───────────┤
│ ⭐       │ User123 │ App crashes on startup...        │ 2.1.0     │
│ ⭐⭐     │ User456 │ Latest update broke widgets...   │ 2.1.0     │
└──────────┴─────────┴──────────────────────────────────┴───────────┘

# Respond directly from terminal
$ pomme reviews respond abc123 "Thank you for your feedback. We've identified the issue and a fix is coming in version 2.1.1!"
```

### Integration with Your Workflow

Pomme's JSON output makes it perfect for automation:

```bash
# Daily sales notification
pomme sales --format json | jq '.revenue.total' | \
  xargs -I {} terminal-notifier -title "Daily Revenue" -message "${}

# Weekly review summary
pomme reviews summary com.example.myapp --format json | \
  jq '.average_rating' > metrics/weekly_rating.txt

# Export for spreadsheet analysis
pomme sales --format csv > ~/Desktop/sales_$(date +%Y%m).csv
```

## Technical Architecture That Makes Sense

### Service-Oriented Design

Pomme follows a clean service architecture:

```go
// Each feature is a self-contained service
type SalesService struct {
    client *Client
    cache  *CacheService
}

// Clear separation of concerns
cmd/pomme/
├── commands/       # CLI command definitions
├── main.go        # Entry point
internal/
├── api/           # App Store Connect client
├── services/      # Business logic
├── models/        # Data structures
├── output/        # Formatting logic
```

### Performance First

- **Concurrent Processing**: Leverages Go's goroutines for parallel API calls
- **Smart Caching**: In-memory cache with automatic expiration reduces API calls
- **Minimal Memory Footprint**: Efficient data structures keep memory usage low

### Multi-Currency Intelligence

One of Pomme's standout features is proper multi-currency support:

```bash
$ pomme sales --detailed
┌─────────────┬──────────┬────────────┬────────────┬───────────┐
│ App         │ Units    │ Revenue    │ Territory  │ Currency  │
├─────────────┼──────────┼────────────┼────────────┼───────────┤
│ MyApp       │ 234      │ $821.00    │ USA        │ USD       │
│             │ 123      │ €456.78    │ Germany    │ EUR       │
│             │ 89       │ ¥12,345    │ Japan      │ JPY       │
│             │ 45       │ £234.56    │ UK         │ GBP       │
└─────────────┴──────────┴────────────┴────────────┴───────────┘
Total Revenue (equivalent): ~$1,843.21 USD
```

## Privacy and Security Considerations

Pomme takes security seriously:

- **Local Storage Only**: Your credentials never leave your machine
- **Secure Key Handling**: Private keys are validated but never transmitted
- **No Analytics**: Zero tracking, zero telemetry
- **Open Source**: Every line of code is auditable

## Taking It Further

### Custom Scripts and Automation

Create a daily dashboard:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# daily_dashboard.sh
echo "📊 Daily App Store Dashboard - $(date)"
echo "================================"
echo
echo "💰 Revenue:"
pomme sales --format json | jq -r '.revenue | "Total: \(.total) (\(.currency))"'
echo
echo "⭐ Reviews:"
pomme reviews summary com.example.myapp --format json | \
  jq -r '"Average: \(.average_rating)/5 (\(.total_reviews) reviews)"'
echo
echo "🔥 Recent Critical Reviews:"
pomme reviews list com.example.myapp --rating 1,2 --limit 3
```

### Integration with CI/CD

Monitor app performance in your build pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/app-metrics.yml
- name: Check App Store Metrics
  env:
    POMME_AUTH_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.APP_STORE_KEY_ID }}
    POMME_AUTH_ISSUER_ID: ${{ secrets.APP_STORE_ISSUER_ID }}
    POMME_AUTH_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH: ./AuthKey.p8
  run: |
    pomme reviews summary ${{ env.APP_ID }} --format json > metrics.json
    if [ $(jq '.average_rating < 4.0' metrics.json) == "true" ]; then
      echo "::warning::App rating dropped below 4.0"
    fi
```

## The Philosophy Behind Pomme

Building Pomme wasn't just about creating another CLI tool. It was about respecting developers' time and workflows. Every decision – from using minimal dependencies to implementing smart caching – stems from real frustration with the status quo.

The name "Pomme" (French for apple) reflects this philosophy: simple, elegant, and quintessentially connected to the Apple ecosystem without the complexity.
